            <div className="about-story-copy">

              <p>
                Agriculture is more than growing food. It is a
                connected journey involving farmers, markets,
                buyers, transportation and countless decisions
                along the way.
              </p>

              <p>
                Yet these parts of the agricultural supply chain
                often operate independently. Farmers may struggle
                to reach the right buyers, buyers may struggle to
                find suitable produce, and logistics can become
                another disconnected layer.
              </p>

              <p>
                KhetLink aims to bring these pieces together through
                a unified digital platform — creating a more
                connected, transparent and efficient agricultural
                ecosystem.

              Let's build a better

            <p>
              The future of agriculture will not be built by one
              person, one farmer or one technology. It will be built
              by connecting the people, ideas and systems that make
              the food supply chain possible.
            </p>

            <p>
              KhetLink is our step toward that future.
